# OpenXTalk Builder Apple PDFKit Library
An OpenXTalk Builder Wrapper Library for Apple's PDFKit framework
This library can create it's own (external NSWindow) window, outside of xTalk engine managed windows, for viewing PDF content.
There is a separate Builder Wrapper for Apple's PDF Kit framework that is implemented as a Widget control.
